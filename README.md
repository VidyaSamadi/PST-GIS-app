Project Screening Tool (PST). PST was developed as part of a SCDOT grant. The tool was developed at the HHR lab during 2018-2019. The tool is smartly designed to gather geospatial data and streamline mitigation calculations and create visualization and a pdf report. Some of the PST widgets are developed from scratch. Dr. Samadi was Co-PI on this grant when she was affiliated with UofSC. Enjoy PST!
